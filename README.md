## PowerKusto

PowerKusto is a powershell module designed to enable you to run queries against Kusto clusters directly from Powershell.

You can already do this with Log Analytics and Resource Graph, using the Azure cmdlets.  This now enables you to work with Azure backend telemetry clusters in a similar fashion.
